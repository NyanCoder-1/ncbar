# NyanCoder's Bar (ncbar)

This is a status bar application for Hyprland. It's for personal use, so most
likely I won't react to pull requests or issues. It renders graphics with Vulkan

## Build

To build this project look at the [BUILD](./BUILD.md)

## Configuration

#### ⚠️ _(not implemented yet, but how I think it should work)_

To configure application create `~/.config/ncbar/config.json` and add the parameters (they merge with defaults first, so you don't need to specify them all)

You also can create a default config file with `./ncbar --generate-config [output-file]` or output current config with `./ncbar --extract-config [output-file]`
